# AGENT INSTRUCTIONS

- This project uses React Native with Expo. Keep styles under `src/` implemented with `styled-components` and prefer composition over inline styles.
- Preserve the glassmorphism aesthetic by leveraging the theme helpers in `src/utils/theme.js` and the reusable components in `src/components/` when touching UI.
- Always update or add Zustand stores instead of introducing alternative state managers.
- Run `npm run test` (or an equivalent automated check) before finishing work on this repo.
